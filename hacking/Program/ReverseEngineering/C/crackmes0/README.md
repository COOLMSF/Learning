# Some Crackmes

These are some crackmes. I wrote them to familiarize myself with reverse engineering, and to show off specific concepts and techniques. 

To work with them, run `make <name>` where `<name>` is one of `crackme01`, `crackme02`, etc. Figure out how to make the crackme exit with the status code 0.

Don't ruin it for yourself by reading the source code! Enjoy.

## Notes

These CRACKMEs are written in C.
