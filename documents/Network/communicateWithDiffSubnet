#This file is to describe how to communicate between different subnets
#Client A:192.168.43.123/24
#Client B:192.168.1.123/24
#Normally these two machines cann't communicate with each other
#But they can with the following steps

#In client A
route add -net 192.168.1.0/24 eth0
#In client B
route add -net 192.168.43.0/24 eth0
#Then they can communicate
