#bc a calulator

echo "1+1" | bc 
echo "scale=4;1/3" | bc //it will print 0.3333(four times)
echo "scale=2;1/3" | bc //it will print 0.33(two times)

a=10
echo "obase=2;$a" | bc //it will print the binary formation of 10

a=0x86
echo "obase=16;ibase=10;$a" | bc //it will change $a(hex) into decimal (ibase = input base) (obase = outbase)
!!!!!!!!! BECAREFUL You should set OBASE first and then IBASE or it may have some errors
