#connect to a remote host
#ssh
#connect a host with username
#ssh username@host
ssh coolder@192.168.1.1

#use ssh without keys
#in client host
ssh-keygen -t rsa //use -t to choose encryption type rsa
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub server_host //copy public key to server
#then you can use ssh without password

#Three ways for ssh

#map 192.168.1.1:21 to localhost:2121
ssh -N -f -L 2121:localhost:21 192.168.1.1

#map localhost:22 to 192.168.1.1:2222
ssh -N -f -R 2222:localhost:22 192.168.1.1

#map 192.168.1.1's all port to localhost:1080
#This usually to make a pc outside of the network
#If so, we should uncomment GateyatPorts which in /etc/sshd_config and do proxy
ssh -N -f -D 0.0.0.0:1080 192.168.1.1
