# Some Crackmes

These are some crackmes. I wrote them to familiarize myself with reverse engineering, and to show off specific concepts and techniques.

I wrote a [tutorial](https://leotindall.com/tutorial/an-intro-to-x86_64-reverse-engineering/) about these crackmes as well.

To work with them, run `make <name>` where `<name>` is one of `crackme01`, `crackme02`, etc. Figure out how to make the crackme exit with the status code 0.

Don't ruin it for yourself by reading the source code! Enjoy.
