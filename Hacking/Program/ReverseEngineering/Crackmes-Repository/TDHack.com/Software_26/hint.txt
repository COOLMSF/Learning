Description:
	Cryptography and something more ;) 	

Content of the task:
	Change one character inside zadanie.com file to see "win" instead of "lose" (nothing else in the output can be changed!).
	To get a proper password you will have to compute: a*b*c, where:
	a = offset with changed character(hex)
	b = changed character(hex)
	c = character which is an replacement for the previous one(hex).
	Finally, change what you get from hex to bin.
